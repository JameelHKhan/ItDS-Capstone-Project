## **Vehicle Fuel Usage by the Department of Public Works**
by Jameel H. Khan  



#### **Problem: What is the problem you want to solve?**  
To identify patterns or trends in the fuel consumption for the fleet of vehicles used by the Department of Public Works. I will also build a predictive model to predict the rate of fuel consumption (i.e. gallons per mile) based on the given factors; the municipality could then use this model to look into the situations that give higher rates of consumption and see if that could be reduced.


#### **Client: Who is your client and why do they care about this problem?**  
My client is the Department of Public Works. They wish to assess their fuel usage with the goal of optimizing their fleet's fuel consumption, leading to reduced fuel costs and the ability to more acurately budget for fuel costs in the next fiscal year.  


#### **Data: What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?**  

I will utilize the Department of Public Work's dataset which contains fuel usage for their vehicles from 2016 to 2018. The data set contains 8,266 rows of data and fields relating to date, time, vehicle ID, fuel type, gallons, and odometer mileage. The data was made available to myself and other Univeristy of Maryland students participating in the 2019 campus-wide Data Challenge Competition and can be found here: [Department of Public Works Fuel Usage Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tgSpZl489ftZHsjYITyFIJkHbemDseR_/view?usp=sharing).  


#### **Approach: How will you solve this problem?**  

I will use R to analyze the data set by comparing multiple datapoints to determine any insights that can be gained.  I will also attempt to build a model of fuel consumption based on the factors within the dataset.  


#### **Solution: What are your deliverables?**  

My deliverables will be:  

* Executive Summary slide deck  
* Paper detailing the following:  
  + problem  
  + approach to solving the problem  
  + data used  
  + process for analyzing the data  
  + results  
 * Code
